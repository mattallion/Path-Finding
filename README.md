# Path-Finding
Uses greedy and A* search algorithms to find a path to a goal.
 
  1. Download pathfinding.py and path_creator.py
  2. Run pathfinding.py and complete the prompts in the console
  3. Output files will be generated in local folder (examples of these in ExampleFiles folder in repo)
     - pathfinding_a.txt and pathfinding_b.txt are grids that have been randomly generated by path_creator.py
     - each starting grid has a starting position and a goal position 
     - additionally, the grid has a boundary and randomly generated obstacles located within the grid
     - pathfinding_a_out.txt and pathfinding_b_out.txt are the solved versions of these maps/grids
     - pathfinding.py uses both greedy and A* search algorithms to find solutions

How to Interpret Output Files:
 - X = border surrounding map + randomly generated obstacles within grid
 - _ = empty spaces on grid
 - S = starting position
 - G = goal position
 - P = path travelled to reach goal from start
